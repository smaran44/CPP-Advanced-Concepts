CPP-Advanced-For-DSA 🚀
Welcome to CP-DSA-Concepts-C++! This repository is crafted to help you master Competitive Programming and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) using C++. It includes structured notes, examples, and concepts explained in a beginner-friendly and practice-focused way.

🔰 Start Here First
Before diving into this repository, make sure you’ve gone through the foundational concepts in CPP-Fundamentals: https://github.com/smaran44/CPP-Fundamentals

This covers all the essential C++ topics you must know before starting CP/DSA: Master Variables & Operators, User Input & Math, Conditionals, Loops, Functions & Scope, Arrays, Strings, Pointers & Memory Management, Advanced Functions & Recursion, Structs & Enums, File Handling, Dynamic Memory Allocation, and Text Processing.

📌 Topics Covered
Object Oriented Programming – OOP, Constructors, Inheritance, Polymorphism & More
Standard Template Library (STL) – Vectors, Maps, Sets, Deques, Queues, Algorithms & Iterators
Mathematics for CP – Primes, GCD/LCM, Modulo, Bitwise Logic, Number Theory
Core Problem Solving – Recursion, Backtracking, Binary Search, Sliding Window
Data Structures – Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Tries, Hashing
Algorithms – Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Topological Sort, Union-Find
Advanced Concepts – Segment Trees, Fenwick Tree, Mo's Algorithm, Convex Hull
